### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Mudit
Dear Shanivi kaul,

Where do I begin with you? Not that we have a ton of memories, but I'd like to believe that what we have is just shy of a ton. I've missed you and your way of saying hellooo👋 a lot since college ended but if there's one thing I've missed more are your chubby cheeks and your hugs! Has anyone ever told you? You give the best and the warmest hugs of all time! ✨
Based on our first meeting, I'd have never imagined you to hold a place in my heart.. The way you do today❤️. So, Thank you so much for your care, kindness, and for being such an amazing friend❤️. You  can’t imagine how much you mean to me. You have the kindest, bravest (the way you sent that email to Bhagat required guts) and the best heart out of everyone I've met and that is truly special and rare. On your special day, I just wanted you to know that I am happy to have such a wonderful person in my life💯. I will remember you in my thoughts forever✨. Here’s wishing you all good things on your birthday. Have an amazing day and a wonderful year ahead (even tho it's 2020)

Happiest birthday bacha❤️
