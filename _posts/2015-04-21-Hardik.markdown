### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Hardik

Hey Shanivi

You're a "special" person because you're the only one who makes notes anymore. ðŸ˜‚
JK. You're a great person and thanks for having our back always. 
Somebody said "The longer you have to wait for something, the more you appreciate it when it finally arrives." So I'd like to say don't worry about celebrating with everyone in person coz it's gonna be a fuckin' event when we finally get to celebrate your birthday together. 

Finally, Happy New Year SHIVANI! ðŸŽ‚ 
Hope you have a great one! Stay safe!
