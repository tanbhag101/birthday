### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Parth

Happiest birthday to the sweetest person I have ever known❤️ Shanivi you have always been a very genuine and caring friend and trust me that is the best thing about you. Thank you for teaching RDMBS and saving our grades. From logistics to gramiksha PR fellow to parties it has been amazing to work and party with you. I’ll always cherish the little little whiskey pegs. Thank you for supporting and saving me in udaipur jab mujhe sunaya jaaraha tha😂 forever indebted to you for that. Lastly always stay the same pure hearted and bubbly person you are madam logistics❤️🍺.
