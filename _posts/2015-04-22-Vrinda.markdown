### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Vrinda
Welcome to the Oldies Club, Shaanu! "It sucks, you are gonna love it" 😂😂
Please tell me you got that reference atleast! Honestly, I won't even be surprised if you didn't, it's been like that for 3 years now🙃

3 years though!!! It definitelyy feels a lot longerr than that because when I look back now, I can't seem to remember a time when I didn't have you in my life, Shainvi♥️ 
It's been a true pleasure to have a person like you in my life! We have had our own share of ups and downs but I still wouldn't trade it for anything in the world, Shalini✨💕

I am reallyy gonna miss the days we have had and the memories we have made along the way, Altu😭
Neverr everr forget that I have got your back and I will always be just a few texts away, Gundiii🙈♥️
