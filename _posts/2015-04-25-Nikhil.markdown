### Happy Birthday Shanivi rom Nikhil

In the past, there have been a lot of moments  where thinking like you has helped me a lot. It has always gotten me out of trouble.
Your presence in my life has made me a better person, I have learnt how to do good to/for people and never expect anything back.
I always wish good things for you and so do the people who have contributed to make this birthday a blast.
To be very honest, you deserve every bit of effort that everyone has put in and maybe even more.

Happy Birthday Shanivi ðŸ’•
