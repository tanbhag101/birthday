### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Shaanvi
Happy 21st birthday Shanivi! 
I hope you achieve more than what you deserve, and you’re always happy in each step of your life. 🌈 

We’ve come a long from just two individuals sharing their names to being best friends and having each other’s back no matter what the distance between us is. I think it commendable that we put in an effort to stay in each other’s life though we were miles apart, it just establishes that we’re sticking close no matter what. I hope it stays that way too 🥰

I always say this and will continue to say that I am thankful for you being around me mentally and emotionally when times were bad and words cannot describe the feeling your emotional presence engenders, like I am not alone, even though literally I am. 🥺

I wish we spoke more often and we asked about each other more because I wouldn’t want to lose you to a mere mistake of lack of communication. Nevertheless, I know i’ll put in however much effort is required to make you stay in my life and I hope you’ll do the same ❤️

Lastly, I hope that happiness flows your way always. I hope each of yours brings immense brightness in your life always. 💖
Love you more than words can describe. 
Shaanvi Mehta 💕
