### Happy birthday Shanivi from Yogesh
Happy Birthday Shanivi . We are friends from 1st year , and i must say that you are a great friend . Yaar tujhe bully krne me bara maza aata tha , phele to tanush was part of it but jab se tum log committed hue ho humara bully krna bhi bandh ho gya. Apart form this,  we have done lot of things together from logistics work to crazy nightouts and made lot of memories to cherish upon .May all your heart desires come true today because it is your day to smile. Your heart should be clouded with happiness and joy because there is nothing more than having someone who is always there when you need them. A lot is going on, and yet, you still found a smile to wear on your birthday. I wish you more smiles and peace even in the most challenging days. I hope every good thing comes your way.  I will be here to celebrate your next birthday and the one after it because you are a friend worth being with at all times. On this awesome day of your life, I wish you the fantastic things you want for yourself. Have a fantastic birthday, my friend.
