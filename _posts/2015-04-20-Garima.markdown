### Happy birthday Shanivi from Garima
Happy Birthday, Shans!

Words will never be enough for me to express what our bond means to me. You've literally been my home, my safe space for the last three years. Thank you so much for being the most understanding person in my life, the crazy fun roommate to create all those amazing memories with, a great friend to go to whenever I needed help and being my family literally all the time.

You are truly the best. Couldn't have asked for a better person to share my space with.

Happy 21st birthday!
I love you! ♥️
