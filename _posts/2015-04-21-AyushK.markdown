### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Ayush
Hey Shanivi, 
This is your old friend kaushik, 
I hope you remember me😂
I know its been long we didn’t meet and didn’t talk either its because both of us are busy with our lives but again and again these special occasions just get us together❤️ 
I still remember the first time you came to my class to meet Nuti for interview of viewfinders and then it just all started with that, from being a member in viewfinders to being the president of it and then all the MUNs. 
Just can’t get over all those memories. 
Just can’t forgot our galleria meetups and hanging out with saina❤️
Its been a great friendship and it will always be a special one to me because you are a gem of a person and deserves the best in the world!! 
Happyyyy birthday Kashmiri imissyou alot and love you more❤️ 
Hope we can take our this friendship for ever. Meet you soon 😭
Love you 
Yours photographer ❤️
