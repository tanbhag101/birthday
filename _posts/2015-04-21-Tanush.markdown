### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Tanush
My beautiful and bossy Shanivi Kaul,

I don’t know what good deeds I did in my life that I landed up on the most incredible human being ever. I really don’t know where to start and what to say. I remember bullying you in between classes, always forming up teams against you and troubling you till you just made the cutest, annoyed face ever (I always melt when I see it). You have been a constant support in my life and I am thankful for each and every moment I ever experienced with you. I love you a lot, always have and always will. Thank you for everything you have ever done for me and will ever do for me. And yes, we belong together, as we are both sick and twisted.

Have a great year ahead (with me, obviously).

P.S. I love you
