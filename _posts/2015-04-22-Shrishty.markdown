### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Shrishty
Same School. Same College. First Friend. First Birthday. First Commitee. First Fest. First Conference. First Senior Crushes. First Outing. First Night Out. First Almost Everything. Together. First everything is always special. So you know all the time we've spent is always going to be super special, a great lineup of firsts, forever. College was so much easier because I always had friends like you from school to always make me feel comfortable and at home! Wish we could have celebrated this birthday together, just like the last 3 birthdays! But I'd prefer not giving u the gift of corona this time and remaining socially distant. Have a great time, stay safe and may god shower you with lots of great opportunities in the upcoming year. Stay blessed!
