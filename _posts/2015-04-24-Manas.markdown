### Happy Birthday Shanivi from Manas

Respected Shanivi Kaul,

What do we cherish most in our life? Is it some memories that we have of places, people, experiences or the people that we touch and get a glimpse of their life and their experiences. I didn’t really had an answer to that question still don’t (lmao), but what I know is I’ve never met a person so good and beautiful,
who could just ameliorate anyone’s suffering or pain just by a simple smile and the warmest hug.
Truly the thing i will miss the most is bumping into you and getting that random cheek pull and hugs. You’ve been a wonderful person not just to me but to all, starting from the first time we met (the interview 😂) to working together, partying together you’ve been the best. I do hope you never change and keep this vibe up 🤙🏻

Thank you for all the care and frankly I’m glad I met you otherwise it would’ve been a great loss.

Happy birthday to the cutest Panda  
Looking forward to sharing finer whiskey together 🥃

P.S. I know a birthday wish isn’t supposed to like this so just pretend to like it.

Yours Sincerely,

Manas Agarwal
