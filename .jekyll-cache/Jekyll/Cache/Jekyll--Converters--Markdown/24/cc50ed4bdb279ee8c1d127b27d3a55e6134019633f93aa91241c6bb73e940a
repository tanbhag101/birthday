<p>Welcome to the Oldies Club, Shaanu! â€œIt sucks, you are gonna love itâ€ ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚
Please tell me you got that reference atleast! Honestly, I wonâ€™t even be surprised if you didnâ€™t, itâ€™s been like that for 3 years nowğŸ™ƒ</p>

<p>3 years though!!! It definitelyy feels a lot longerr than that because when I look back now, I canâ€™t seem to remember a time when I didnâ€™t have you in my life, Shainviâ™¥ï¸ 
Itâ€™s been a true pleasure to have a person like you in my life! We have had our own share of ups and downs but I still wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything in the world, Shaliniâœ¨ğŸ’•</p>

<p>I am reallyy gonna miss the days we have had and the memories we have made along the way, AltuğŸ˜­
Neverr everr forget that I have got your back and I will always be just a few texts away, GundiiiğŸ™ˆâ™¥ï¸</p>
