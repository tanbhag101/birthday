<p>I donâ€™t want to write things that everyone will say to you. Yes youâ€™re the sweetest person we all know and youâ€™re super understanding and there for me always blah blah blah.. 
What I really want to say is that I donâ€™t need it to be your birthday to feel blessed to have you. You canâ€™t even imagine what it is like if I donâ€™t talk to you even for a single day or if we get into an argument which we rarely do. Youâ€™re my support system since day 1 and I wouldnâ€™t have it any other way. 
Iâ€™m super super possessive about you and I donâ€™t like it when you have other people who are close to you but thatâ€™s just how i am and i know youâ€™ve had to make peace with it. 
Iâ€™m lucky to have been by your side for all your first times. ( you know what i mean ) and there are so many more to come! 
I love you regardless of what i say or show and I canâ€™t imagine even a single hour without you. I know its unbelievable and chape but itâ€™s true. 
Like i said, youâ€™re my past, my present and my future and i forever wish mumma asks me whoâ€™s on the phone and i say my boyfriend and she says acha Shanivi se hi baat kar rahe hoge. 
I know i have a lot of best friends but theyâ€™re all my lifelines and youâ€™re the oldest snd strongest one. 
Happiest Birthday. Have the BEST day and the bestest life. 
You know you love me 
xoxo</p>
