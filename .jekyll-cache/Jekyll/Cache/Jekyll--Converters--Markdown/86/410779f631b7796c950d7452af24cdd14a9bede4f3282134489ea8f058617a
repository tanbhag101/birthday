<p>Happy birthday Shanivi!ðŸ¥³
Youâ€™re the one of the sweetest persons I have come across, Itâ€™s hardly been 1 year since we met but itâ€™s so much fun to hangout with you, and I can always count on you for some great girl advice. Cheers to all the memories, from HK to clubbing to Ludo to Jaisalmer. Have a great quarantine bday ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤© hopefully we will be able to celebrate in college! Have fun ðŸ¥°</p>
