<p>Happy birthday Shanivi!! ❤️
I just want you to know how wonderful, kind and an amazing person you are. Every memory I have with you is awesome, from being gramiksha’s best ever volunteers and crazzyyy dancing partners 😜 anytime 😂, to the best bhabhi ever🥳. Really looking forward to have a blast so that we could again dance madly on Tanush’s insane playlist 😍🔥. 
I wish you all the best for future and…stay happy, stay safe! 😊
Will meet soon🍻</p>
