<p>Respected Shanivi Kaul,</p>

<p>What do we cherish most in our life? Is it some memories that we have of places, people, experiences or the people that we touch and get a glimpse of their life and their experiences. I didnâ€™t really had an answer to that question still donâ€™t (lmao), but what I know is Iâ€™ve never met a person so good and beautiful,
who could just ameliorate anyoneâ€™s suffering or pain just by a simple smile and the warmest hug.
Truly the thing i will miss the most is bumping into you and getting that random cheek pull and hugs. Youâ€™ve been a wonderful person not just to me but to all, starting from the first time we met (the interview ğŸ˜‚) to working together, partying together youâ€™ve been the best. I do hope you never change and keep this vibe up ğŸ¤™ğŸ»</p>

<p>Thank you for all the care and frankly Iâ€™m glad I met you otherwise it wouldâ€™ve been a great loss.</p>

<p>Happy birthday to the cutest Panda<br />
Looking forward to sharing finer whiskey together ğŸ¥ƒ</p>

<p>P.S. I know a birthday wish isnâ€™t supposed to like this so just pretend to like it.</p>

<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

<p>Manas Agarwal</p>
