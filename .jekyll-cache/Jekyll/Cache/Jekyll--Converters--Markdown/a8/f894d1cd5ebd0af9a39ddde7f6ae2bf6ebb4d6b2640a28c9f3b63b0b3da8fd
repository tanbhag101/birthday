<p>Hii Shanivi ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è 
Happy Birthday, you little (actually monstrous) bundle of joy.</p>

<p>Thank you for always sticking around for everything, being the sweetest person I know and so fucking understanding.</p>

<p>I know that sometimes we don‚Äôt qualify to your standard of life and because of that you have to say no to us repeatedly for many things, but I understand that and I hope we keep getting better so that one day you also have more interest in spending time with us.</p>

<p>All that said, Abhivarta, Udaipur and Jaisalmer are memories I won‚Äôt ever forget. Teaching you how to dance better, making you a better person are parts of things I will continue to do and obviously you can‚Äôt survive without that either.</p>

<p>Anyway, Happy Birthday - I genuinely hope you have the best year ahead and success comes to you the way you want throughout this year ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
