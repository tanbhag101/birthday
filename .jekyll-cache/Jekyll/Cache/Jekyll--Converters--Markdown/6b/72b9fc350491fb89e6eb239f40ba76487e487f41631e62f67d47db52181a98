<p>I seriously cannot fathom that you’re twenty one and we’re literal adults ! it’s absolutely surreal and I cannot wait to see what life has in store for us next !! it’s been one hell of journey through ‘choti choti gayia’ (idk how to spell it), to MUN’s to farewells and tuitions. I can’t thank you enough for being my best friend through it all and always being there no matter what 😍 
while we may have missed some parts of each others lives when we weren’t friends in middle school, im certain that for years to come we’ll get to share our milestones with each other and I wouldn’t have it any other way🥰 
here’s to you shan!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHICHI ♥️♥️♥️♥️loads of love and hugs!!!</p>
