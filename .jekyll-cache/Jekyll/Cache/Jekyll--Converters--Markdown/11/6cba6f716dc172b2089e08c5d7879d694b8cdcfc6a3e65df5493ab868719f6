<p>Dear Shanivi kaul,</p>

<p>Where do I begin with you? Not that we have a ton of memories, but Iâ€™d like to believe that what we have is just shy of a ton. Iâ€™ve missed you and your way of saying helloooğŸ‘‹ a lot since college ended but if thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™ve missed more are your chubby cheeks and your hugs! Has anyone ever told you? You give the best and the warmest hugs of all time! âœ¨
Based on our first meeting, Iâ€™d have never imagined you to hold a place in my heart.. The way you do todayâ¤ï¸. So, Thank you so much for your care, kindness, and for being such an amazing friendâ¤ï¸. You  canâ€™t imagine how much you mean to me. You have the kindest, bravest (the way you sent that email to Bhagat required guts) and the best heart out of everyone Iâ€™ve met and that is truly special and rare. On your special day, I just wanted you to know that I am happy to have such a wonderful person in my lifeğŸ’¯. I will remember you in my thoughts foreverâœ¨. Hereâ€™s wishing you all good things on your birthday. Have an amazing day and a wonderful year ahead (even tho itâ€™s 2020)</p>

<p>Happiest birthday bachaâ¤ï¸</p>
